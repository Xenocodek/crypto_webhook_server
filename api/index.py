"""
This file can be used as an entry point for Vercel if the project structure requires it.
For simple FastAPI apps, vercel.json can point directly to the FastAPI app instance in main.py.

In our vercel.json, we have:
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "main.py", // Points to main.py in the root of crypto_webhook_server
      "use": "@vercel/python",
      "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "15mb", "runtime": "python3.9" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "main.py" // All requests are routed to the app in main.py
    }
  ]
}

So, the `main.py` in the root of the `crypto_webhook_server` directory (which contains `app = FastAPI()`) will be used by Vercel.
This `api/index.py` file is kept for compatibility or if a different Vercel configuration is chosen later that might expect an entry point in an `api` directory.
For the current `vercel.json`, this file is not strictly the primary entry point being used.
"""

# To make this file a valid Vercel entry point for a FastAPI app defined in `../main.py`:
# from ..main import app

# This assumes `main.py` is in the parent directory and `app` is the FastAPI instance.
# The `vercel.json` provided directly uses `main.py` from the project root, so this `api/index.py` is more of a placeholder or alternative setup.

# If `main.py` was inside the `api` folder, then `from .main import app` would be used,
# and `src` in `vercel.json` would be `api/main.py` or `api/index.py` if this file imports the app.

# Given the current vercel.json, this file is not actively used as the main handler.
# The `main.py` in the root of `crypto_webhook_server` is the handler.
